## üé® Design Philosophy

### Color Palette
The design uses a professional and trustworthy color scheme. A deep, sophisticated green serves as the primary brand color, creating a sense of expertise and success.

### Typography
The **Poppins** font (from Google Fonts) is used throughout the site. Its modern, geometric, and sans-serif style ensures high readability and gives the page a clean, contemporary feel.

### Layout & Spacing
A mobile-first approach was taken. The layout incorporates a generous amount of white space to avoid clutter and improve focus. Content is structured in a clear visual hierarchy, guiding the user's eye through the page.
